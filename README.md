The shell of the final web page is Org.Awgis.html

The area with the problem is Right-col.html. 
Right-col is referenced the same way in the combined html project. It is towards the bottom of the code.


The style sheet is Style.css for the project


The main idea is to have the map displayed on the right column, which covers 85% of the web page.

The left column will contain otions to switch between the different layers representing the mangrove cover over the stated years.
